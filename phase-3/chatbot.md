Todo AI Chatbot - Phase III
An AI-powered chatbot interface for managing todos through natural language using MCP (Model Context Protocol) server architecture and Claude Code with Spec-Kit Plus.

🎯 Objective
Create an intelligent chatbot that allows users to manage their todos through natural language conversations. The system leverages MCP server architecture to expose task operations as tools that AI agents can utilize.

✨ Features
Conversational interface for todo management
Natural language processing for task creation, modification, and deletion
MCP server exposing task operations as tools
Stateless chat endpoint with persistent conversation state
AI agents utilizing MCP tools for task management
Secure authentication system
🛠️ Technology Stack
Component	Technology
Frontend	OpenAI ChatKit
Backend	Python FastAPI
AI Framework	OpenAI Agents SDK
MCP Server	Official MCP SDK
ORM	SQLModel
Database	Neon Serverless PostgreSQL
Authentication	Better Auth
🚀 Development Approach
This project follows the Agentic Dev Stack workflow:

Write specification
Generate implementation plan
Break into manageable tasks
Implement via Claude Code
Note: No manual coding is allowed in this project. All implementation is done through AI-assisted development using Claude Code and Spec-Kit Plus.

📋 Requirements
Basic Level Functionality
 Implement conversational interface for all basic features
 Use OpenAI Agents SDK for AI logic
 Build MCP server with Official MCP SDK that exposes task operations as tools
 Stateless chat endpoint that persists conversation state to database
 AI agents use MCP tools to manage tasks
 MCP tools are stateless and store state in the database

🛠️ Setup Instructions
Prerequisites
Node.js (for frontend and MCP server)
Python 3.9+ (for backend)
PostgreSQL-compatible database (Neon recommended)
Backend Setup
cd backend
pip install -r requirements.txt
# Configure your database connection in .env
python main.py
Frontend Setup
cd frontend
npm install
npm run dev
MCP Server Setup
# MCP server configuration
npm install @modelcontextprotocol/sdk
# Follow the MCP server setup guide
🧠 AI Integration
The system uses OpenAI Agents SDK to process natural language inputs and convert them into actionable todo operations. The MCP server acts as a bridge between the AI agents and the task management system.

🗄️ Database Schema
The application uses SQLModel ORM with Neon Serverless PostgreSQL. The schema includes:

User authentication tables
Conversation state storage
Todo items with metadata
MCP tool interaction logs
🔐 Authentication
The system implements Better Auth for secure user authentication and session management.

🤖 MCP Tools
The MCP server exposes the following tools for AI agents:

create_todo: Create a new todo item
update_todo: Modify an existing todo item
delete_todo: Remove a todo item
list_todos: Retrieve all todo items for a user
get_todo: Retrieve a specific todo item
