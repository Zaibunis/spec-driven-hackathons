# Create Spec for Todo Console App

## Summary

Created the feature specification for Phase I of the todo application evolution: an in-memory Python console application with basic todo functionality.

## Details

The specification defines a Python console application that implements 5 basic todo features:
- Add Task (title, description)
- View Task List (with status indicators)
- Update Task (edit title/description)
- Delete Task (by ID)
- Mark Complete/Incomplete

The spec includes user scenarios, functional requirements, key entities, and success criteria that align with the project's constitutional requirements for spec-driven development.

## Outcome

A complete feature specification has been created that will guide the implementation of the console-based todo application.

## Evaluation

The specification meets all requirements:
- Defines clear user scenarios with priorities
- Includes testable functional requirements
- Specifies measurable success criteria
- Identifies key entities and edge cases
- Maintains technology-agnostic success criteria

PROMPT_TEXT: ```text
Phase I – In-Memory Python Todo Console ApplicationTarget outcome:A clean, maintainable Python 3.13+ command-line Todo app that stores tasks in memory and implements all 5 Basic Level features using Spec-Driven Development with Claude Code and Spec-Kit Plus.Core functionality:- Add Task (title, description)- View Task List (with status indicators)- Update Task (edit title/description)- Delete Task (by ID)- Mark Complete/IncompleteSuccess criteria:- All 5 basic features implemented exactly as defined- Runs entirely in the console using in-memory data structures- Clean Python project structure under /src- All code generated by Claude Code (no manual coding)- Repository includes: Constitution, specs history, source code, README.md, and CLAUDE.md- Code meets clean code principles and is fully reproducible from specsConstraints:- No external database; storage must be purely in-memory- Use UV + Python 3.13+- Only basic level features allowed in Phase I (no priorities, tags, search, reminders, etc.)- All implementation must follow iterative spec refinement until correctNot building:- Web frontend or REST API- Authentication or multi-user support- AI chatbot, MCP server, or Agents SDK- Kubernetes or cloud deployment
```

RESPONSE_TEXT: Created the feature specification for the Phase I in-memory Python todo console application, including user scenarios, functional requirements, success criteria, and a quality checklist.
